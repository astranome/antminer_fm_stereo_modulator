## 🚀 Quick Start

1.  **SD Card Image:** Download and write the image to a flash drive:
    [📥 **antminer_fm_sd_image.img.zip**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zJ9alWn_ooUUDolYVYJMz_-qFWlah9bX/view?usp=sharing)

2.  **Set Jumpers:** Set the jumpers on the board to the SD card boot position, as shown in the photo above.

3.  **Antenna:** Solder a ~78 cm wire to the **TXD9** contact on the **back side** of the board (see solder point photo).

4.  **Network:** Connect the board via Ethernet to a network with DHCP and internet access.

5.  **Reception:** Tune your FM receiver to **96.0 MHz**. The carrier will appear about half a minute after power is applied, once Linux boots.

6.  **Ready:** After boot, a script will automatically start, and internet radio broadcast will begin.

> ℹ️ **Note:** To disable internet radio autostart, comment out the `/root/ep.sh` line in the `/etc/rc.local` file.

## 🛠 Usage

### Console Management Utility `fm`
After the system boots, connect via SSH to fm.local and launch the program with the command    
```bash
/root/fm
```
It provides an interface for configuring transmitter parameters and monitoring.
Press the "A" key to enable automatic level indicator refresh.

**Building from source code (if necessary):**
```bash
gcc fm.c -o fm -lm
```

**Example utility interface:**
![control panel](images/fm.gif)

**Control keys:**
*   `1-5` – Toggle corresponding parameter (TX, STEREO, RDS, MUTE, Pre-emphasis).
*   `F` – Change broadcast frequency.
*   `A` – Enable auto-refresh of level indicators.
*   `L` – Load configuration from file (`/etc/fm_transmitter.conf`).
*   `S` – Save current configuration.
*   `Q` – Quit the utility.

All settings are saved in the `/etc/fm_transmitter.conf` file.

### Audio Playback
*   **Local File:** Play test audio file:
    ```bash
    ./play_song.sh
    ```
*   **Internet Radio:**
    ```bash
    ./ep.sh
    ```
    Stop broadcast: `killall vlc`.
*   **Play Axia LiveWire (AES67) stream:**
    ```bash
    ./rx_livewire_aes67.sh [channel_number]
    ```
    Example for channel 51: `./rx_livewire_aes67.sh 51`.

### How to output audio from StereoTool:
![Настройка Stereo tool](images/stereo_tool.png)

1.  In the StereoTool program, **enable** HD output.
2.  In the dropdown menu, **select** LiveWire+ AES67 or Generic AES67.
3.  **Set** the Volume slider to **25%**.
4.  In the **Signal selection** field, specify **"De-emphasized version of FM output"**.
5.  The **NIC** field can be left on **Auto**, set any channel number, but it must match the setting on the stereo modulator.
6.  **Via SSH**, log into the board (`tx.local`, login `root`), go to the `/root` folder, and run the script with the channel number, for example:
    ```bash
    ./rx_livewire_aes67.sh 5001
    ```
    Audio will be transmitted over the network via UDP Multicast — the network card's IP address is not important. Good luck!

## ❓ FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### What is the actual sound quality?
**Purest stereo sound without analog distortion.** The only drawback is the occasional chance of hearing faint digital noise in silence, but it's usually imperceptible.

### What is the actual range?
**In urban conditions:** 100-200 meters  
**In open terrain with line of sight:** up to 300-400 meters  
Range also depends on receiver sensitivity, presence of interference, and antennas used.

### How to transmit sound from a computer?
Install the virtual sound card Axia LiveWire, and your computer becomes a professional audio source for the transmitter. Detailed instructions for output from StereoTool are provided above.

### How to SSH in?
Connect via SSH to host **tx.local** (login **root**, no password).

### Can the frequency be changed?
Yes, it can be changed directly from the console utility `./fm` (press the `F` key).
Or direct selection - `./set_freq 96.5`

### How to increase power?
This implementation does not provide for this, as using an amplifier would also amplify the noise level, which is already quite high.

### Will boards from other miners work?
Yes, if they have Zynq 70xx and similar architecture.

### What sound level is optimal for full deviation of +/-75 kHz?
Full deviation of +/-75 kilohertz, including RDS and pilot tone deviation, corresponds to a sound level of -9dBFS (1000Hz sine wave).

### What is the output power level?
When connected directly to a power meter with a 50 Ohm characteristic impedance, without matching elements, it was around 16 mW.

The project is under active development. Much of the planned functionality is not yet implemented or needs refinement, but you can already enjoy high-quality stereo sound.

**Priority tasks:**
*   **RDS Encoder:** Implementation of the software part for the already prepared modulator in the FPGA
*   **Management Interface:** Improvement of the console interface and creation of a Web interface for frequency adjustment, pre-emphasis control, modulation parameter monitoring, etc.
*   **Multi-channel capability:** With proper optimization, it will be possible to broadcast at least 2-4 radio stations simultaneously.
*   **Documentation:** Improvement of instructions and technical descriptions
